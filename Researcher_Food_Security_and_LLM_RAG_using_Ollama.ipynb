      " The increases in global food prices throughout 2022 (as reported in the 2023 report) have significantly affected food security, as highlighted in the 2024 report. Here's a comparison between the two reports:\n",
      "\n",
      "    - In the 2023 report, the average cost of a healthy diet globally was 3.56 PPP dollars per person per day. However, this figure rose to 3.96 PPP dollars in 2022 (as reported in the 2024 report), marking an increase of 11% between 2021 and 2022. This surge represents a strain on household budgets, particularly for those already struggling with food insecurity.\n",
      "    - The World Food Import Bill was estimated to have reached an all-time high in 2022 (nearly USD $2 trillion), a 10% increase from the 2021 level. This significant rise in import costs affected countries heavily dependent on food imports, exacerbating their food security challenges.\n",
      "    - World fertilizer prices also surged in 2022, primarily due to rising energy and natural gas prices. The global agricultural input import bill increased by 48% in 2022 to USD $424 billion. Higher prices for agricultural inputs can strain farmers' budgets, impacting their ability to afford necessary inputs and potentially reducing food production.\n",
      "    - Additionally, increased investment in renewable energy in 2022 contributed to a major jump in FDIs supportive of food security and nutrition, which can have positive long-term effects on food security if these investments lead to increased agricultural productivity and resilience. However, the short-term impact of this investment increase may not significantly alleviate the challenges caused by higher food prices.\n",

Higher food prices can have a detrimental effect on food security, particularly for vulnerable households in certain regions. This is because a healthy diet becomes less affordable with rising prices, placing an additional burden on these households.\n",

      "In 2022, the average cost of a healthy diet globally increased to 3.96 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars per person per day, up from 3.56 PPP dollars in 2021. This price hike was caused by various factors such as disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in international food and energy prices, thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures.\n",

The world food import bill reached an all-time high of nearly USD 2 trillion in 2022, resulting from the increased cost of food imports. In addition to these factors, higher energy and natural gas prices caused a soar in global agricultural input costs, which led to further price increases at local and national levels.\n",

Higher food prices can have a detrimental effect on food security, particularly for vulnerable households in certain regions. This is because a healthy diet becomes less affordable with rising prices, placing an additional burden on these households.\\n\\nIn 2022, the average cost of a healthy diet globally increased to 3.96 purchasing power parity (PPP) dollars per person per day, up from 3.56 PPP dollars in 2021. This price hike was caused by various factors such as disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, which led to significant increases in international food and energy prices, thereby exacerbating inflationary pressures.\\n\\nMoreover, countries that are heavily dependent on food imports were particularly affected by this rise in international food prices. The world food import bill reached an all-time high of nearly USD 2 trillion in 2022, resulting from the increased cost of food imports. In addition to these factors, higher energy and natural gas prices caused a soar in global agricultural input costs, which led to further price increases at local and national levels.\\n\\nIn summary, increasing food prices can have a negative impact on food security by making healthy diets less affordable for vulnerable households, particularly in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia, where rapid urbanization is leading to rising and changing food demand.',\n",
